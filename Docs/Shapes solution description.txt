CalCon Refactoring Description

1. Identify the most offensive code "smells"
Description:

- Object oriented approach misuse

- For a set of named constants better use Enum

- "Property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field."
  To avoid side effects better way to use property for private fields access and methods for additional logic.

2. Identify potential problems that could be encountered in developing and/or maintaining a system that uses the code as it is written
Description:

- Functional extension could be difficult

- Logging not implemented


3. Describe why your refactored code would be better than the original code.

- After the programm run and execute console window close immidiately, user can't see result. (ReadLine added)

- User input should be validated

- Throw exeption is not the best way to inform user that something wrong in application for number of reason.
  Better way is provide meaningful description and exit application

- For better user experience we can provide possibility calculate areas for number of shapes without programm restart
